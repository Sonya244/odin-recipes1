    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
        <li> <strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown sugar</strong>: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Bananas</strong>: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugar in another bowl. Add the eggs and mashed bananas.</li>
        <li> Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven.</li>
     </ol>
