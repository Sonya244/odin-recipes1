    <h1>Swedish meatballs</h1>
    <img src = "/swedish-meatballs.jpeg"></img>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These heavenly Swedish Meatballs are a homemade version of the iconic Ikea meatballs. They’re a whole lot easier than assembling flat-pack furniture, that’s for sure! Extra-soft and juicy,<br> with a dash of classic spices like allspice, they’re smothered with the bread-mop-worthy sauce.</p>
    <p>If you’re wondering what’s so special about Swedish Meatballs, or what they taste like, close your eyes and imagine this: incredibly soft meatballs, made extra juicy by using a combination<br> of both pork and beef and soaked bread instead of breadcrumbs, lightly spiced with just a touch of nutmeg and all spice that gives it the signature Swedish flavour, smothered in a creamy<br> gravy that is absolutely to-die-for.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef AND pork</strong> – the beef gives it flavour, the pork gives it juiciness and tenderness;</li>
        <li><strong>Bread</strong> – the secret to extra soft meatballs! Far more effective than breadcrumbs;</li>
        <li><strong> and All Spice</strong> – the signature spicing, just a small, subtle amount. All Spice is a particular type of spice made from a plant called Pimenta dioica. It smells like cloves. It’s a common spice found in normal supermarkets, and costs no more than usual spices. Best substitute is Mixed Spice.</li>
        <li><strong>Beef stock/broth and cream</strong> – for the creamy gravy;</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong> – to thicken the gravy;</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong> – for binding the meatballs together.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in the mixing bowl. Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon meat mixture per meatball; form into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes. Insides of meatballs will still be pink. Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving dish.</li>
        <li>Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into drippings until smooth. Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2 1/2 cups liquid. Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve gravy with meatballs.</li>
     </ol>
